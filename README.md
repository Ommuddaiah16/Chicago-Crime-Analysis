# Chicago Crime Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict crime incidents in Chicago using historical and recent crime data. The primary objective is to identify patterns, trends, and hotspots within the city to support strategic decision-making, improve resource allocation, and contribute to reducing crime rates and enhancing public safety.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains records of reported crimes in Chicago, with fields including:
- **ID**: Unique identifier for each crime incident
- **Case Number**: Unique case number assigned to each incident
- **Date**: Date and time when the crime occurred
- **Block**: Block where the crime occurred
- **IUCR**: Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting code assigned to the crime type
- **Primary Type**: Primary classification of the crime
- **Description**: Detailed description of the crime
- **Location Description**: Description of the location where the crime occurred
- **Arrest**: Indicates whether an arrest was made (TRUE/FALSE)
- **Domestic**: Indicates whether the crime was domestic-related (TRUE/FALSE)
- **Beat**: Police beat where the crime occurred
- **District**: Police district where the crime occurred
- **Ward**: Ward where the crime occurred
- **Community Area**: Community area where the crime occurred
- **FBI Code**: FBI code classification for the crime
- **X Coordinate**: X coordinate of the crime location
- **Y Coordinate**: Y coordinate of the crime location
- **Year**: Year when the crime was reported
- **Updated On**: Date when the record was last updated
- **Latitude**: Latitude of the crime location
- **Longitude**: Longitude of the crime location
- **Location**: Combined latitude and longitude in a string format

## Goals
### Temporal Analysis
- **Crime Trends Over Time**: Examine how the number of crimes has changed over the years.
- **Peak Crime Hours**: Determine the times of day when crimes are most frequently reported.

### Geospatial Analysis
- **Crime Hotspots**: Identify areas with high concentrations of crimes using latitude and longitude coordinates.
- **District/Ward Analysis**: Compare crime rates across different districts and wards.

### Crime Type Analysis
- **Distribution of Crime Types**: Analyze the frequency of different crime types and descriptions.
- **Severity Analysis**: Investigate the distribution of severe crimes versus less severe crimes.

### Arrest and Domestic Incident Analysis
- **Arrest Rates**: Calculate the percentage of crimes that result in an arrest.
- **Domestic vs. Non-Domestic Crimes**: Compare the characteristics and frequencies of domestic-related incidents versus non-domestic incidents.

### Location-Specific Analysis
- **Location Description Analysis**: Investigate the most common locations for crimes.
- **Comparison by Beat and Community Area**: Analyze crime data by beat and community area to identify localized crime patterns and hotspots.

### Seasonal and Weather Impact
- **Seasonal Trends**: Examine whether certain types of crimes are more prevalent in specific seasons.

### Repeat Offenders and Recidivism
- **Repeat Crime Locations**: Identify locations that are repeatedly associated with criminal activity.
- **Recidivism Rates**: Analyze recidivism rates and factors contributing to repeat offenses.

### Predictive Modeling and Risk Assessment
- **Predictive Analysis**: Develop models to predict future crime incidents based on historical data.
- **Risk Assessment**: Assess the risk of different areas and times for specific types of crimes to help in resource allocation for law enforcement.
